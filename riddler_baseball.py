Assume you have a sport (let’s call it “baseball”) in which each team plays 162 games in 
a season. Assume you have a division of five teams (call it the “AL East”) where each 
team is of exact equal ability. Specifically, each team has a 50 percent chance of 
winning each game. What is the expected value of the number of wins for the team that
finishes in first place?
