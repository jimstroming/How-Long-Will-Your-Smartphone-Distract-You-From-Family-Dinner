Assume you have a sport (let’s call it “baseball”) in which each team plays 162 games in 
a season. Assume you have a division of five teams (call it the “AL East”) where each 
team is of exact equal ability. Specifically, each team has a 50 percent chance of 
winning each game. What is the expected value of the number of wins for the team that
finishes in first place?

Need to make an assumption about interdivision ve intradivision games.
Let's start with the way the schedule is doen currently:
19 games against each of your 4 division opponents.
86 games outside your division.
