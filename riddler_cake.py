"""Can you bake the optima cake.
From the 538 riddler
http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-bake-the-optimal-cake/

A mathematician who has a birthday coming up asks his students to 
make him a cake. He is very particular (he is a constructive set 
theorist, which explains a lot) and asks his students to make him a 
three-layer cake that fits under a hollow glass cone he has on his desk. 
(The cone was given to him as a prize for proving an obscure theorem 
long ago.) He requires that the cake fill up the maximum amount of 
volume under the cone as possible and that the layers of the cake 
have straight vertical sides. (Again, the guy’s particular.) What are 
the thicknesses of the three layers of the cake in terms of the height 
of the glass cone? What percentage of the cone’s volume does the cake 
fill?
