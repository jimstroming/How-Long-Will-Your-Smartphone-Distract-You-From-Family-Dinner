First, how long is the longest path a knight can travel on a standard 
8-by-8 board without letting the path intersect itself?

Second, there are unorthodox chess pieces that dont exist in the 
standard game, which are known as fairy chess pieces.  
What are the longest nonintersecting paths that can be taken by the 
camel (which moves like a knight, except 3 squares by 1 square), 
the zebra (3 by 2), and the giraffe (4 by 1)?
