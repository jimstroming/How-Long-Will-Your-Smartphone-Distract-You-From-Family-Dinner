A university has 10 mathematicians, each one so proud that, if she learns that she made 
a mistake in a paper, no matter how long ago the mistake was made, she resigns the next 
Friday. To avoid resignations, when one of them detects a mistake in the work of another, 
she tells everyone else but doesn’t inform the mistake-maker. All of them have made 
mistakes, so each one thinks only she is perfect. One Wednesday, a super-mathematician, 
whom all respect and believe, comes to visit. She looks at all the papers and says: 
“Someone here has made a mistake.”

What happens then? Why?

--------

I don't see how coding would help solve this logic problem, so I will solve
in a text file.

Seems like a variation of the red hat / white had problem.
Have to understand what one mathematician deduces the others know.

Start with simpler cases:

------

Two mathematicians.

1 knows 2 made a mistake.
If 1 did not make a mistake,
then 1 knows that 2 would not have been told anything.
Thus, when the super says someone made a mistake, 
2 would know 2 was wrong, if 1 has not make a mistake.

So, if 2 does not resign on Friday, 1 will resign.  Let's assume
this resignation becomes effective the following Friday.
The same reasoning apples to 2.
So no one will resign on Friday, and both will resign the following Friday.
