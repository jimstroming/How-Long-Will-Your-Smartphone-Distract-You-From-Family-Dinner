A university has 10 mathematicians, each one so proud that, if she learns that she made 
a mistake in a paper, no matter how long ago the mistake was made, she resigns the next 
Friday. To avoid resignations, when one of them detects a mistake in the work of another, 
she tells everyone else but doesn’t inform the mistake-maker. All of them have made 
mistakes, so each one thinks only she is perfect. One Wednesday, a super-mathematician, 
whom all respect and believe, comes to visit. She looks at all the papers and says: 
“Someone here has made a mistake.”

What happens then? Why?

I don't see how coding would help solve this logic problem, so I will solve
in a text file.

Seems like a variation of the red hat / white had problem.
Have to understand what one mathematician deduces the others know.
