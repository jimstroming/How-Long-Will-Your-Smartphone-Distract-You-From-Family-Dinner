Five couples attend a party. They have hugged each other and said their goodbyes
but before they leave, the 10 people arrange themselves in a straight line at
random to take a photograph. (All possible lineups are equally likely.) What is 
the probability that no person in the line is standing next to his or her 
partner?
"""

Let's start with the simpler cases and see if there is a pattern

2 couple party

1 2 3 4   together
1 2 4 3   together
1 3 2 4
1 3 4 2   together
1 4 2 3
1 4 3 2   together

So, for the 2 person party
P(together) = 4/6 = 2/3
P(not together) = 1/3
