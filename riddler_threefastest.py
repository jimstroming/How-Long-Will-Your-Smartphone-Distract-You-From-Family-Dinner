# You, a very wealthy aristocrat, own 25 horses. You are bored one day (you are bored everyday) 
# and decide to amuse yourself by identifying the three fastest horses in your stable. 
# However, your personal racetrack is severely lacking in capacity, and you 
# can only race five horses at a time. What is the minimum number of races you will need 
# to organize to identify your three fastest horses?

# My son suggested 11 races.  Five first round races, that elminated the bottom two in each race,
# then six follow up races.  

# To do better, let's still do the first five round races:  Let's say the results were

# Race 1: 1,2,3,4,5
# Race 2: 6,7,8,9,10
# Race 3: 11,12,13,14,15
# Race 4: 16,17,18,19,20
# Race 5: 21,22,23,24,25

# This eliminates horses 4,5,9,10,14,15,19,20,24,25

# For race 6, let's race  the winners to find the fastest horse.  Say the results are

# Race 6: 1,6,11,16,21

# So, now we know that Horse 1 is the fastest horse.  6 at best is the 2nd fastest horse.  
# That eliminates horse 8.  
# 11 at best is the 3rd fastest horse.  That eliminated horse 12 and 13.
# And all the horses in race 4 and 5 are eliminated.

# Race 7 is now between all the horses remaining contention for 2nd and 3rd plae.

# Race 7: 2, 3, 6, 7, 11

# So, seven races are needed to find the three fastest.
