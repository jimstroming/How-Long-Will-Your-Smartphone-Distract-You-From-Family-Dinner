# You, a very wealthy aristocrat, own 25 horses. You are bored one day (you are bored everyday) 
# and decide to amuse yourself by identifying the three fastest horses in your stable. 
# However, your personal racetrack is severely lacking in capacity, and you 
# can only race five horses at a time. What is the minimum number of races you will need 
# to organize to identify your three fastest horses?
